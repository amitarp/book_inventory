# Book Inventory

Used Tkinter to make an application that records the entries of book. It can add,update or delete the entries made to it. 
And then made that file into an exectuable file so you don't need to download python to run this appliation. You can see the code for static tkinter in frontend.py. And backend.py contains the functions that make this project more dynamic.
